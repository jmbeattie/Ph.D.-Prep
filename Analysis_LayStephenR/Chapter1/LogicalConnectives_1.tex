\section{Mark each statement as True or False. Justify each answer.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In order to be classified as a statement, a sentence must be true.
	\subitem False; statements must be either true or false, but not both.
	
	\item Some statements are both true and false.
	\subitem False; a statement cannot be both true and false.
	
	\item When statement $p$ is true, then its negation $\neg p$ is false.
	\subitem True; this is the definition of negation
	
	\item A statement and its negation may both be false.
	\subitem False; this violates the definition of negation. The negation of a statement must evaluate to the opposite truth value of the statement.
	
	\item In mathematical logic, the word ``or'' has an inclusive meaning.
	\subitem True; by default, ``or'' is inclusive. There is a seperate operation for ``exclusive or''.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mark each statement as True or False. Justify each answer.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In an implication $p \implies q$, statement $p$ is referred to as the proposition.
	\subitem False; $p$ is referred to as the antecedent. The whole implication is a single proposition.
	
	\item The only case where $p \implies q$ is false is when $p$ is true and $q$ is false.
	\subitem True; this is the definition of implication.
	
	\item ``If $p$, then $q$ is equivalent to ``$p$ whenever $q$''.
	\subitem False; a statement that if false can imply a statement that is true. ``$p$ whenever $q$ is actually logical equivalence (\textit{if and only if}).
	
	\item The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negation of the individual parts.
	\subitem True; The negation of a conjunction is a disjunction of negations. This is often referred to as DeMorgan's Law.
	
	\item The negation of $p \implies q$ is $q \implies p$.
	\subitem False; True will still imply true and false will still imply false. The negation of implication is ``$p$ and not $q$''.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Write the negation of each statement}
\begin{itemize}
	\item$M$ is a cyclic subgroup.
	\subitem $M$ is not a cyclic subgroup.
	
	\item The interval [0,3] is finite.
	\subitem The interval [0,3] is not finite.
	
	\item The relation R is reflexive and symmetric.
	\subitem The relation R is neither reflexive or symmetric.
	
	\item The set $S$ is finite or denumerable.
	\subitem The set $S$ is infinite and uncountable.
	
	\item If $x>3$, then $f(x)>7$.
	\subitem $x>3$ and $f(x) \leq 7$.
	
	\item If $f$ is continuous and $A$ is connected, then $f(A)$ is connected.
	\subitem $f$ is continuous and $A$ is connected and $f(A)$ is not connected.
	
	\item If $K$ is compact, then $K$ is closed and bounded.
	\subitem $K$ is compact and $K$ is neither closed or bounded.
\end{itemize}

\section{Write the negation of each statement}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The relation R is transitive.
	\subitem The relation R is not transitive.
	
	\item The set of rational numbers is bounded.
	\subitem The set of rational numbers is unbounded.
	
	\item The function $f$ is injective and surjective.
	\subitem The function $f$ is neither injective or surjective.
	
	\item $x<5$ or $x>7$.
	\subitem $x \geq 5$ and $x \leq 7$.

	\item If $x$ is in $A$, then $f(x)$ is not in $B$.
	\subitem $x$ is in $A$ and $f(x)$ is in $B$.
	
	\item If $f$ is continuous, then $f(S)$ is closed and bounded.
	\subitem $f$ is continuous and $f(S)$ is open or unbounded.

\end{itemize}

\section{Identify the antecedent and the consequent in each statement.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $M$ has a zero eigenvalue only if $M$ is singular.
	\subitem Antecedent: $M$ has a zero eigenvalue.\\ Consequent: $M$ is singular.
	
	\item Normality is a necessary condition for regularity.
	\subitem Antecedent: Regularity\\ Consequent: Normality
	
	\item A sequence is bounded if it is Cauchy.
	\subitem Antecedent: A sequence is Cauchy.\\ Consequent: It is bounded.
	
	\item If $x=5$, then $f(x)=14$.
	\subitem Antecedent: $x=5$\\ Consequent: $f(x)=14$
